          A <a>single rate commission</a> plan, also called a flat rate commission plan or a fixed rate commission plan, pays set, non-changing sales commission rates on all deals. Unlike multiple rate commission plans, the commission rate doesn't increase or decrease based on quota attainment, different products, longer contract terms, or any other variable. This is the most simple commission plan that salespeople may have.
